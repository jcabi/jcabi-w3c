W3C HTML Java Validator

  Validate your HTML against
  {{{http://validator.w3.org/nu/}W3C Markup Validation Service}}
  with this code.

+--
public class My {
  public void main() {
    String xhtml = "<html><body><p>Hello, world!</p></body></html>";
    ValidationResponse response =
      new ValidatorBuilder().html().validate(xhtml);
    assert response.valid();
  }
}
+--

  Similar mechanism is available for
  {{{./html-validator-local-instance.html}HTML local validation}}
  and
  {{{./css-validator.html}CSS validation}}.

  All events are logged through {{{http://www.slf4j.org/}slf4j}},
  using <<<"com.jcabi.w3c">>> logger.
  If you want to see them, just add proper binding to classpath,
  as explained in {{{http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html}SLF4J manual}}.
