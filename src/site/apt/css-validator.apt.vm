W3C CSS Java Validator

  Validate your CSS against
  {{{http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/}W3C Jigsaw validator}}
  with this code:

+--
public class My {
  public void main() {
    String css = "body { font-family: Arial; }";
    ValidationResponse response =
      new ValidatorBuilder().css().validate(css);
    assert response.valid();
  }
}
+--

  Similar mechanism is available for
  {{{./html-validator.html}HTML validation}}.

  All events are logged through {{{http://www.slf4j.org/}slf4j}},
  using <<<"com.jcabi.w3c">>> logger.
  If you want to see them, just add proper binding to classpath,
  as explained in {{{http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html}SLF4J manual}}.
