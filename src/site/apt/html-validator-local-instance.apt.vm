W3C HTML Java Validator (Local)

  Validate your HTML against a local instance of
  {{{http://validator.w3.org/nu/}W3C Markup Validation Service}}
  installed in your server as describes the following
  {{{https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Local_W3C_HTML5_Validator_Server.html}tutorial}}.


  Install required packages.

+--
apt-get install w3c-markup-validator mercurial subversion python default-jdk
+--

  Compile/install the HTML5 validator (not included in W3 validator).

+--
mkdir /usr/share/html5-validator
cd /usr/share/html5-validator
+--

  Set the <<<JAVA_HOME>>> path.

+--
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk
+--

  Clone the latest validator source.

+--
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/validator/build build
+--

  Start the build (If you encounter a Java exception, run the build script again).

+--
python build/build.py all
+--

  Configuring the w3c-validator to allow private networks in <<</etc/w3c/validator.conf>>>.

+--
Allow Private IPs = yes
+--

  Enable the HTML5 validator by uncommenting the following.

+--
<![CDATA[
  <External>
  HTML5 = http://localhost:8888/html5/
  </External>
]]>
+--

  Create the upstart script to start the HTML5 validator at boot.

+--
vim /etc/init/html5-validator.conf
+--

  Contents.

+--
description "Validator.nu HTML5 Validator"

start on (local-filesystems and net-device-up)
stop on runlevel [016]

chdir /usr/share/html5-validator
exec python build/build.py --control-port=8889 run
respawn
+--

  Save and start it.

+--
start html5-validator
+--

  Afterwards you can access your validator via <<<http://server/w3c-validator>>> and set the URI in your code.

+--
public class My {
  public void main() {
    String xhtml = "<html><body><p>Hello, world!</p></body></html>";
    URI instanceURL = new URI("http://server/w3c-validator/check")
    ValidationResponse response =
      new ValidatorBuilder().html(instanceURL).validate(xhtml);
    assert response.valid();
  }
}
+--

  Similar mechanism is available for
  {{{./html-validator.html}HTML remote validation}}
  and
  {{{./css-validator.html}CSS validation}}.

  All events are logged through {{{http://www.slf4j.org/}slf4j}},
  using <<<"com.jcabi.w3c">>> logger.
  If you want to see them, just add proper binding to classpath,
  as explained in {{{http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html}SLF4J manual}}.
